Phonon website
==============

#### Visualize phonons, excitons, structures, and isosurfaces

This repository contains the web applications behind the phononwebsite project.
It started as a phonon visualization tool and now also includes dedicated pages for
exciton wavefunctions and crystal structures / charge-density isosurfaces.

Project repository:
<https://github.com/henriquemiranda/phononwebsite>

The phonon viewer lets you inspect phonon dispersions and animate vibrational modes.
The exciton viewer shows exciton wavefunctions on real-space grids.
The structure viewer can display crystal structures, repetitions, and charge-density
isosurfaces with either marching cubes or raymarch rendering.

How to use?
===========

In the phonon section you can click any point in the dispersion and see an animation
of the corresponding lattice vibration. The website can display built-in example
datasets, contributed materials, Materials Project OpenData-derived phonons, and
locally hosted converted datasets.

If you want to inspect your own calculations, the phonon viewer currently supports
data from [`phonopy`](https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/),
[`Abinit`](https://www.abinit.org/),
[`Quantum Espresso`](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/), and
[`VASP`](https://www.vasp.at/).

[`phonopy`](https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/)
-------
You can visualize your own `phonopy` files by clicking on the `Choose files` button and selecting a `band.yaml` file. The following options should be present in the `band.conf` file:

    EIGENVECTORS = .TRUE.
    BAND_CONNECTION = .TRUE.
    BAND_LABELS = Gamma M K
    BAND = (x1,y1,z1) (x2,y2,z2) (x3,y3,z3)

This works with newer `phonopy` versions where `band.yaml` carries the structural
information needed by the website.

[`Abinit`](https://www.abinit.org/)
------
To read a phonon dispersion from `Abinit` you need python scripts to convert the phonon dispersion data to the internal `.json` format used by the website.

The recommended way to do so is to use [abipy](https://github.com/abinit/abipy).
Once you have generated a `DDB` file, you can create a JSON file with:

    $ abiopen.py mp-149_DDB

    In [1]: phbst, phdos = abifile.anaget_phbst_and_phdos_files()
    In [2]: phbst.phbands.view_phononwebsite()

If you already have a PHBST.nc netcdf file produced by anaddb you can visualize it with:

    $ abiview.py phbands example_PHBST.nc -web

Alternatively you can use the scripts provided in the [Github](https://github.com/henriquemiranda/phononwebsite/) page. To install them just do:

    $ pip install -e ./python

In the folder where you ran `anaddb` you will find a netCDF file (if you compiled `Abinit` with netCDF support) with the name `anaddb.out_PHBST.nc`. To convert it to `.json` format just run:

    $ read_anaddb_phonon.py anaddb.out_PHBST.nc <name_of_your_material>

You can then select the resulting `.json` file with the `Choose files` button on the `phononwebsite`.

[`Quantum Espresso`](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/)
----------------
To read a Quantum Espresso calculation you need two files `<prefix>.scf` and `<prefix>.modes`.
The first one is the input file for `pw.x` the second one can be generated with `dynmat.x`.
The file that should be used is the one set with the `'filout'` tag in the dynmat input file as in it the modes are normalized with the atomic masses.
After installing the python scripts (same as in the case of an `Abinit` calculation) you can obtain the `.json` files:

    $ read_qe_phonon.py prefix <name_of_your_material>

You can then select the resulting `.json` file with the `Choose files` button.

[`VASP`](https://www.vasp.at/)
----------
To read a VASP calculation you need the `vaspout.h5` file containing a phonon dispersion calculation.
You can find the instructions of how to compute the phonon dispersion from a supercell calculation in the [VASP wiki](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Computing_the_phonon_dispersion_and_DOS)

    $ read_vasp_phonon.py vaspout.h5 <name_of_your_material>

You can then select the resulting `.json` file with the `Choose files` button.

Pages using this visualization tool
========================================

This visualization tool is currently also used in:

- <https://materialsproject.org/>
- <https://www.materialscloud.org/>

Features
========
You can export an animated `.gif` with a particular mode using the `gif` button.
WebM export is also available in browsers that support native `MediaRecorder`.

If you want to share your own data with someone else, you can pass URL parameters in
the following format:

    http://henriquemiranda.github.io/phononwebsite/phonon.html?tag1=a&tag2=b

The available tags are:

    json = link to a json file
    yaml = link to a yaml file
    name = name of the material

Here are some examples of what can be added to the website link:

  - [?yaml=http://henriquemiranda.github.io/phononwebsite/test/fixtures/phonopy/band.yaml](http://henriquemiranda.github.io/phononwebsite/phonon.html?yaml=http://henriquemiranda.github.io/phononwebsite/test/fixtures/phonopy/band.yaml)

You are free to use the images generated with this website in publications and
presentations as long as you cite this work (a link to the website is enough). For
the license terms of data imported from external databases such as
[phonodb](http://phonondb.mtl.kyoto-u.ac.jp/), please refer to the original source.

In polar materials, LO-TO splitting may be missing in older PhononDB-derived data.

Install dependencies:

    npm install

Build the local site into `build/`:

    npm run build

Start a local server from `build/`:

    cd build

Authors
=======

This project is the continuation of work started by Raoul Weber during an internship
at the University of Luxembourg in the Theoretical Solid State Physics group under the
supervision of Ludger Wirtz.

It later evolved into a broader browser-based visualization toolkit. The original
JSmol-based approach was replaced by a custom Three.js / WebGL viewer (`VibCrystal`),
and the project now also supports user-provided calculations and additional pages for
excitons and structures.
